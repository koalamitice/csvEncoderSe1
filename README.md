# csvEncoderSe1

**This tool is depricated and no longer updated!** <br>

It was used during the corona pandemic at the TU Braunschweig. The Software Engineering 1 course was held entirely online and this tool helped us to visualize student contributions in the exercises. 

**HowTo:** <br>
- pull repo <br>
- start the encoder by executing csvDecoder.jar (use can use the java -jar command) <br>
- test files are included in the *TestFiles* directory <br>
